4 Contributors Chiseled In Stone Lyrics You ran cryin' to the bedroom I ran off to the bar Another piece of heaven gone to hell The words we spoke in anger Just tore my world apart And I sat there feeling sorry for myself Then that old man sat down beside me And looked me in the eye And said "Son, I know what you're going through You ought to get down on your knees And thank your lucky stars that you got someone to go home to." (Chorus) You don't know about lonely Or how long nights can be Till you lived through the story That's still livin' in me And you don't know about sadness 'til you faced life alone You don't know about lonely 'til it's chiseled in stone So I brought these pretty flowers Hoping you would understand Sometimes a man is such a fool Those golden words of wisdom From the heart of that old man Showed me I ain't nothing without you You might also like You don't know about lonel
